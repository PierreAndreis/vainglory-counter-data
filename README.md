# Vainglory Hero Counter Data

## What is this
This is a "webapp" that uses the Vainglory API to search Vainglory matches and retrieve data about hero matchups. It looks at ranked matches from patch 2.12 (which can be changed in filters.js).

## Try it out
Fork it or download it and add your Vainglory API key to filters.js. Then open index.html in any browser. Register for a key at [developer.vainglorygame.com](https://developer.vainglorygame.com/).

Data is always saved to local storage, so feel free to close the window and reopen it at any time without worrying about losing data.

This only runs locally currently, so I am in the process of moving it to Node.js as a properly functioning webapp.
